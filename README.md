================================================================================

vsp stats processor is a multi game - log analyzer/stats generator/log parser. 
It can process log files from several games including Quake 3 Arena (q3a), 
Halflife 1, 2, Counter Strike Source (hl), Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory (wet), 
Return to Castle Wolfenstein (rtcw), Call Of Duty, COD: United Offensive (cod), 
Medal of Honor Allied Assault, MOHAA: Spearhead, MOHAA: BreakThrough (moh), 
Soldier of Fortune 2 (sof2), etc. It reads the log files generated by a game 
and displays various game statistics. vsp also supports both server logs (ex:- 
games.log for Q3A) and client logs (ex:- qconsole.log for Q3A).
```

For more details I suggest to take a look at the readme files:
